# Build the Hotspot Arcade .fap with the ESP firmware bundled inside it.
#
# The .fap ships the ESP32 firmware images via fap_file_assets (see
# application.fam): the loader extracts them to /ext/apps_assets/hotspot_arcade/ on
# launch, so a fresh install of just the .fap makes "Install Firmware" work with no
# SD setup. Firmware images are build artifacts, so this wrapper regenerates them
# into flipper/hotspot-arcade/assets/firmware/ (next to the committed flash.txt)
# before running ufbt. CI should call this instead of bare `ufbt`.
#
# Steps: build the ESP firmware (arduino-cli) -> copy its images + the core's
# boot_app0.bin into assets/firmware/ -> run ufbt.
#
# If arduino-cli isn't available it falls back to the already-built images in
# esp32/hotspot-arcade-fw/build/ (and errors if those are missing too).
#
# Usage: 
#   tools/build-fap.sh
#   BOARD=wroom tools/build-fap.sh   # single-board variant (s2|wroom|c5)

# One core for every board. The S2 and WROOM were pinned to 2.0.17 for a long time; the
# reason was never really "different WiFi/USB behaviour on 3.x" as the old comment here
# claimed, it was that the S2 would not LINK -- the 3.x core gives it 8 KB less dram0 and
# the sketch overflowed it. Moving the Zobrist table into flash and the trivia topics and
# the UART receive buffer off static DRAM fixed that (dram0 free went from -6,560 to
# +14,304 bytes, better than the 9,960 the 2.x core left), so the split is gone and every
# board now gets DHCP option 114, which only exists in the 3.x line.
