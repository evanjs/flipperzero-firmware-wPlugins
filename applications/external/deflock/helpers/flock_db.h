 * camera -- including ones nothing had tied to Flock, and including the
 * competitor hardware now replacing Flock in cities that dropped it. That is the

 * is not enough to avoid calling a gunshot sensor a camera if we then call an
 * Axon camera a Flock camera.
 *
 * DERIVED, NEVER TRANSMITTED. The vendor is re-derived on this side from the MAC
 * and SSID we stored, exactly like flock_method_of(), and is deliberately NOT a
 * field the companion asserts. So it cannot inherit an over-claim from firmware
 * that lags the app, it costs nothing on the wire, and it needs no store-format
 * change -- a record loaded from a v1 CSV re-derives its vendor for free.
